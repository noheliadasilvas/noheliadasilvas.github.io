								<h2>About Me</h2>
							</header>
							
							<p>
								I grew up in Caracas, Venezuela, where I dedicated most of my childhood to competitive gymnastics. This experience taught me discipline, resilience, and a sharp attention to detail, qualities that have shaped my approach to life and learning. Gymnastics also fueled my curiosity about the human body and health, sparking a deep interest in medicine from a young age.
							</p>
							<p>
								In 2016, I moved to Atlanta to attend the Georgia Tech Language Institute, and by 2018, I was accepted as an undergraduate student. My initial goal was to study biology and eventually go to medical school, as I believed that was the best path to impact people’s health. However, after taking my first programming class, I was introduced to a whole new world—I had no idea what programming was, but I quickly became fascinated by the limitless possibilities it offered. I’ve always loved solving problems logically, and programming felt like an extension of that passion. Realizing how multidisciplinary and powerful technology could be in addressing complex medical challenges, I decided to switch my major and earned my BS in computer science in 2022.
							</p>
							<p>
								After completing my bachelor’s, I continued my journey at Georgia Tech with a master’s degree in machine learning. This field intrigued me because, while it’s cutting-edge and innovative, it’s often seen as a black box. I was determined to understand the math and theory behind machine learning algorithms and apply them to solve real-world problems, particularly in healthcare. The constant advancements in technology have only strengthened my resolve to stay at the forefront of this field, as I believe it holds the key to the future. Upon graduation, I moved to Indianapolis to work for Eli Lilly, where I’m now fulfilling my dream of helping people through medical innovation and technology.
							</p>
							<p>
								My curiosity has always extended beyond technology itself—I’ve long been fascinated by the complexity of the human brain and how it enables us to think, feel, and process emotions. With the rise of AI, I’m especially interested in the intersection between AI and neuroscience. Bridging the gap between artificial intelligence and our understanding of the human mind not only excites me but feels essential to advancing both fields. I’m eager to continue pushing the boundaries of machine learning and neuroscience, exploring how we can enhance both AI systems and our understanding of human cognition.
